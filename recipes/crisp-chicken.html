    <h1>Crisp Chicken Recipe</h1>

    <h2>This is a recipe for deliciously crispy baked chicken. The coating of the chicken is made of crushed potato chips which provides a lovely crispy skin. Also, this chicken is baked so you get that great cruncy exterior with very juciy and flavourful chicken. Added bonus of it being a healthier option to frying, saving the calories but not sacrafising flavour!</h2>
