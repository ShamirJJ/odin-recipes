# odin-recipes

This is the first project in the Odin Project cirriculum.

I will be creating a recipe website showing multiple recipes on different web pages within a website.

This will be created using HTML only.

Once completeed, this project will demostrate an understanding of HTML structure, using the HTML boiler plate to establish the structure of the content on the webpage. It will also demonstrate an understanding of how the anchor tabas will be used to allow for hyper links to be included in the website to link through to different web pages.

This project will also demonstrate an understanding of file structure within the project, understanding what paths to use within the href link or image SRC link in order to use the image I want in specific web pages within the website.
